Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

This project is a Machine Learning classifier that predicts whether a sonar signal has bounced off a rock or a mine. The dataset consists of 60 features representing the energy of sonar signals at different frequencies.

🔍 Project Overview

Goal: Classify sonar signals as Rock (R) or Mine (M).

Dataset: Sonar dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression.

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn.

⚙️ Workflow

Load and explore the dataset.

Preprocess data and split into training & testing sets.

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate model performance (accuracy on train & test sets).

Build a prediction system for new input sonar signals.

📊 Results

Achieved good accuracy on both training and testing data.

Model generalizes well for unseen sonar signals.
